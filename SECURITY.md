# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version available in the `main` branch is considered supported.

Security updates are not provided for older commits, forks, or derivative works.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue describing the vulnerability
- **Do not** disclose the issue publicly until it has been reviewed

Instead, report security issues by contacting the project author directly.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact and affected components
- Any relevant logs or proof-of-concept code (if available)

## Response Expectations

Since this project is maintained by a single developer:

- Vulnerability reports will be reviewed on a best-effort basis
- There are no guaranteed response or fix timelines
- Critical issues affecting data confidentiality or integrity will be prioritized

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- Backend API services
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data storage and file handling logic

The following are **out of scope**:
- Issues in third-party dependencies
- Misconfiguration of Docker, Docker Compose, or hosting environments
- Vulnerabilities caused by modified or forked versions of the project

## Responsible Disclosure

Responsible disclosure is appreciated.  
Public disclosure of vulnerabilities without prior notice may result in the report being ignored.
